### KV键值对

```bash
➜  ~ consul kv
Usage: consul kv <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for interacting with Consul's key-value
  store. Here are some simple examples, and more detailed examples are
  available in the subcommands or the documentation.

  Create or update the key named "redis/config/connections" with the value "5":

      $ consul kv put redis/config/connections 5

  Read this value back:

      $ consul kv get redis/config/connections

  Or get detailed key information:

      $ consul kv get -detailed redis/config/connections

  Finally, delete the key:

      $ consul kv delete redis/config/connections

  For more examples, ask for subcommand help or view the documentation.

Subcommands:
    delete    Removes data from the KV store
    export    Exports a tree from the KV store as JSON
    get       Retrieves or lists data from the KV store
    import    Imports a tree stored as JSON to the KV store
    put       Sets or updates data in the KV store
```

```bash
➜  ~ consul kv put name fangfang
Success! Data written to: name
```

### 分布式锁

```bash
➜  ~ consul lock -h
Usage: consul lock [options] prefix child...

  Acquires a lock or semaphore at a given path, and invokes a child process
  when successful. The child process can assume the lock is held while it
  executes. If the lock is lost or communication is disrupted the child
  process will be sent a SIGTERM signal and given time to gracefully exit.
  After the grace period expires the process will be hard terminated.

  For Consul agents on Windows, the child process is always hard terminated
  with a SIGKILL, since Windows has no POSIX compatible notion for SIGTERM.

  When -n=1, only a single lock holder or leader exists providing mutual
  exclusion. Setting a higher value switches to a semaphore allowing multiple
  holders to coordinate.

  The prefix provided must have write privileges.
```
