## 本地启动

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tone-row/flowchart-fun.git
cd flowchart-fun
yarn
yarn start
```

```
this app works by typing
  new lines create new nodes
    indentation creates child nodes 
    and any text: before a colon+space creates a label
  [linking] you can link to nodes using their ID in parentheses
    like this: (1)
    lines have a default ID of their line-number
      but you can also supply a custom ID in brackets
        like this: (linking) // use single line comments
/*
or 
multiline 
comments

Have fun! 🎉
